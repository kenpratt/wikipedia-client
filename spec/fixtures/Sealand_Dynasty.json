The dynasty, which had broken free of the short lived, and by this time crumbling [[Babylonian Empire]], was named for the province in the far south of [[Mesopotamia]], a swampy region bereft of large settlements which gradually expanded southwards with the silting up of the mouths of the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] rivers. The later kings bore fanciful pseudo-[[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] names and harked back to the glory days of the dynasty of [[Isin]]. The third king of the dynasty was even named for the ultimate king of the dynasty of Isin, [[Damiq-ilishu|Damiq-ili\u0161u]]. Despite these cultural motifs, the population predominantly bore Akkadian names and wrote and spoke in the [[Akkadian language]]. There is circumstantial evidence that their rule extended at least briefly to [[Babylon]] itself.\n\n==The King list tradition==\n\nThe king list references which bear witness to the sequence of Sealand kings are summarized below:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n!
