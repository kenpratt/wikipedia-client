The '''Middle Ages''' (adjectival form: '''medieval''' or '''mediæval''') is a period of [[European history]] covering roughly a [[millennium]] from the [[5th century]] through to the [[16th century]]. It is commonly dated from the [[Decline of the Roman Empire|fall of the Western Roman Empire]], and contrasted with a later [[Early Modern Period]]; the time during which the rise of [[humanism]] in the [[Italian Renaissance]] and the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] unfolded, are generally associated with the transition out of the Middle Ages, with European overseas expansion as a succeeding process, but such dates are approximate and based upon nuanced arguments.

More specific starting and ending points are sometimes adopted by scholars to suit their respective specializations or current focus. In particular, in British history, the Middle Ages are often understood to start at the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]] of 1066 and continue through to about the end of the 15th century (the era between the fall of the Roman Empire and the Norman conquest is referred to as the [[Anglo-Saxon England | Anglo-Saxon]] period). "[[#Periodization issues|Periodization issues]]" are discussed in a later section of this article.

The Middle Ages included the first sustained [[urbanization]] of northern and western [[Europe]]. Many modern European countries owe their origins to events and trends in the Middle Ages; present European political boundaries are, in many regards, the result of the military and dynastic outcomes during this period.
