<p><b><i>Velociraptor</i></b> (; meaning 'swift seizer'<ref name=osborn1924a/>) is a genus of dromaeosaurid theropod dinosaur that existed approximately 75 to 71&nbsp;million years ago during the later part of the Cretaceous Period.<ref name=PGetal2008/> Only two species are currently recognized, although others have been assigned in the past. The type species is <i>V. mongoliensis</i>; fossils of this species have been discovered in both Inner and Outer Mongolia in central Asia. A second species, <i>V. osmolskae</i>, was named in 2008 for skull material from Inner Mongolia.</p>
<p>Smaller than other dromaeosaurids like <i>Deinonychus</i> and <i>Achillobator</i>, the turkey-sized <i>Velociraptor</i> nevertheless shared many of the same anatomical features. It was a bipedal, feathered carnivore with a long, stiffened tail and an enlarged sickle-shaped claw on each hindfoot, which is thought to have been used to kill its prey. <i>Velociraptor</i> can be distinguished from other dromaeosaurids by its long and low skull, with an upturned snout.</p>
<p><i>Velociraptor</i> (commonly shortened to 'raptor') is one of the dinosaur genera most familiar to the general public due to its prominent role in the <i>Jurassic Park</i> motion picture series. In the films it was shown with anatomical inaccuracies, including being much larger than it was in reality and without feathers. It is also well known to paleontologists, with over a dozen recovered fossil skeletons—the most of any dromaeosaurid. One particularly famous specimen preserves a <i>Velociraptor</i> locked in combat with a <i>Protoceratops</i>.</p>
